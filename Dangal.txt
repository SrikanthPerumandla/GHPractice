Yet another perfect movie from the perfectionist. Dangal gives you a peek in to lots of lives who have a commitment towards sports and passion towards nation but also the problems they face while they fulfill their dreams. Entire cast Aamir, Sakshi, Fatima, Saanya, Zaira and Suhani did an excellent job and justice to their roles. Needless to say Aamir excels to do what he is good at and keeps you occuppied with his intense acting. The female leads (especially the younger and older Geeta) were awesome in their roles when it comes to the tackle scenes be it in the mud or on the turf. The camera work capturing fights in the bout needs a special mention here as they stand out and gives you a treat of a real combat between two wrestlers. For those who saw the trailers multiple times the first half is an easy guess about what happens next, but otherwise the movie is excellent piece of work by the entire crew of Dangal. Full marks to the Director, Aamir and his girls.
